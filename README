DESCRIPTION
-----------

This project is a native BMLT client app for iOS (iPhones, iPads, iPod Touch, etc.). It is different from the Web-based
app, because most of the action happens in the device; not on the Web server or Web browser.

The app uses the XML export function of the BMLT root server (http://magshare.org/blog/export-options/) to gather data on
the BMLT root servers, and will, eventually, execute searches transparently across multiple servers.

The initial version of the app will be "tuned" to specific servers, as opposed to being a general-purpose app.

NOTE ON CODE QUALITY
--------------------

This project is a personal "training course." It is my "Hello World" program for iOS.

As such, the quality will not be up to that generated by fully-experienced iOS software engineers, but it won't be bad. I develop
using a number of best practices that should result in decent quality code.

It will probably be a lot lighter on comments than code folks are used to seeing from me. I plan to revisit the code as time allows,
and improve the commenting. In the meantime, I am following good coding practices and trying to write code that is sensible and fairly
self-explanatory.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This is an iOS app, made for iPhones and iPads. It is only available via the Apple App Store.

INSTALLATION

CHANGELIST
----------
= Version 1.0b3 =
* TBD

= Version 1.0b2 =
* October 16, 2011
* Reduced the file size slightly, by removing some unused images.
* Made the formats in the meeting detail view a bit bigger, so they will be easier for chubby fingers.

= Version 1.0b1 =
* October 15, 2011
* If there is only 1 result in the list, the time/distance sort will not be shown.

= Version 1.0b0 =
* October 14, 2011
* The localization for the settings items wasn't being done. That is now fixed.
* Added the ability to dynamically update the location from the settings dialog, including adding a new button.
* The tabs now reset to their root view when they are deselected. This prevents searches from being left open.
* The Settings tab really needs to be always portrait for iPhone.
* Made it easier to add new variants.

= Version 1.0a3 =
* October 13, 2011
* Disable the swipes in the List and Map screens when there are search results present.
* in some cases, there may be no distance in the returned meetings. I now hide the distance sort and the invalid distance, if that happens.
* There was a bug in the Prefs screen, where touching the text for Prefer Distance Sort changed both it, and the one above. That has been fixed.

= Version 1.0a1 =
* October 12, 2011
* Removed the dimming of the Prefer Distance Sort switch if Core Location services are unavailable, or if the Find My Location is off. It did not make sense.

= Version 1.0a0 =
* October 11, 2011
